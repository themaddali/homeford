LICENSING
=========

As of now there is no licensing for the front end.
Actually there wont be licensing for frontend ever.
There are several libraries and codes repos used in getting this to the current
state. We havent given a great thought on the license models. Most of the libraries 
we use are MIT licensed. If you find we are using some of your licensed stuff, let
us know and we will pull it down ASAP. Honestly we dont have time/money to entertain 
legal followups.
